**Design Summary:**

What I have created for this assignment, or project, is what I would call a "Door or Window Security System". This creation is meant to act as an alarm in case of an unwanted break in. You would set the box in front of a door's or window's open radius, plugged into a wall port, then upon activation (through the correct input on the keypad) would place the servo in front of said door, or window, so that if it were to be opened than it would sound it's alarm (the alarm is a buzzer and LED that flash and sound). 

Include Photos and Diagrams of overall project


**System Details:**

-The design of my project is fairly simple, as you can see, the containment of it is a plain box with some exit points for the main pieces. They include the alarm, led, sensor, and keypad which are all displayed on one face of the cardboard box. On the other side is an opening for the raspberry pi and its wire, which is plugged into the wall. The internall parts include the raspberry pi, sauder breadboard, wires, and servo which all help to operate the overall mission. 

-The idea of this design is to enter the correct code into the keypad, this activates the servo to move the sensor in place. The sensor will record the first distance which will constantly be recorded and looked at to seek any changes (a door opening or person walking in front of it) that may occur after activation. If the sensor is triggered then it stops recording distance and the buzzer and LED are set off.

-Include photos that are labeling parts


**Design Evaluation:**

-I believe that I have a fairly succesfull project and that I meet almost all of the elemental categories. I have the basic ones such as an output display in the form of an LED and a Buzzer, as well as an automatic sensor and a manual user input. I believe that I meet all of these except for the Manufacturing which is clearly lacking as the casing for the overall hardware is not finalised.


**Parts List:** Basic For Now
* Servo
* Buzzer
* Red LED
* Distance Sensor
* 4x4 Keypad
* Raspberry Pi
* Cardboard
* Adhesives
* Wires
* Resistors
* Saudered Breadboard


**Lessons Learned:**
* During this project I learned how to use prior knowledge and some research to create something that hasn't given specific instructions on how to be built.
* One of my most important skills/lessons learned during this "final" was how to problem solve and to debug, especially when it comes to coding something new.
* I learned that not everything will work on the first try and to give yourself some wiggle-room in case if something were to go wrong.
* A lesson that I learned this semester is that nothing comes easy and if you want something done you have to work for it and put in the effort the you want to come out of it.

**Instructions on How to Build Your Own--**

* First you will need all the code and the specific items that I have listed in the previous information.
* After you have both of them you can put all of the code into a file on your raspberry pi so that it can run properly.
* You will need to use the specific pins that I have used in this project when wiring the accessories or find them in my code and change them to the correct pins.
* Once these steps are completed you will need to create a box or find some container that can be used to hold all of the requiered items.
* Once you have the box you will creat some holes for the keypad, LED, and buzzer to stick out of, and some kind of lever for the sensor to be monuverable. You will also need to create some kind of hole to easily acces the hardware and to hold the servo in a place where it can move the sensor into position.
* When all of the previous steps are completed all that you need to do afterwards is make any personal adjustements to the hardware or software to better it for your own personal use!
