**Sensor and LED coding so far:**

*  The sensor and it's coding are funtional so far. As of right now my sensor, or it's code, records the distance repeatedly until the distance reaches over 1000 cm in which it will print a simple message.

*  My LED is also functional, because it can turn on when I have it turn on, the only downside to it right now is that the pin for the LED has to be moved. I plan on fixing this issue so I only have to use 1 pin. I also plan on connecting it to my other code sometime in the future, so that it will reacte according to my sensor.
