1. I haven't started the project, but I plan on starting with getting the main (distance) sensor to record distances and set off a simple LED.
2. I haven't ordered any parts yet. 
3. I haven't completed/started any designs but I plan on having the casing prototype to be done by the end of March.
4. I hope, that if I do so, that I will get full credit on this project. 
5. The 3 most significant design challenges that I forsee in this project are moving the sensor without it triggering, having a ccertain key/password that activates the system, and having the sensor to be set on an initial distance.
